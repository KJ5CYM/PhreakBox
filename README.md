# What does it do?
PhreakBox is a Windows user interface for playing DTMF, BlueBox, and RedBox phreaker tones. The most important feature is the auto dial function. To auto dial DTMF or MF, simply enter the number you wish to dial and press `Dial!` For MF speed dialing the KP and ST tones are played automagically! Make sure to keep the .wav files in the executable's directory.

# Why???
I had collected quite the sampling of .wav sound files from the old phreaker boxes during my experimentation with Project MF, which is a payphone simulator.

I needed a quick way to play them out loud into Project MF's simulated payphone trunk, so PhreakBox was born!


I used the Bloodshed Dev-C++ IDE for the programming. Gross.
